AVTV

AV Club web scraper: it fetches a TV show's grades and plots a graph with them. Run it (navigate to the directory, enter "ruby av_club_graph.rb"), enter the name of a TV show, and it'll plot a graph: episode # on the x-axis, grade on the y-axis. It also generates an html file that interacts with Chart.js to output a graph. This directory contains a preview of what the graphs will look like: http://www.tcnj.edu/~christj6/new/shows/
